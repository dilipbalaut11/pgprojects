- Merge pg_qualstat and HypoPG code under single extension
- Preserve hash to disk - qualstat/workload and overhead on shutdown
  - Take feedback from Tom/Ben that do we need to preserve this hash to disk is there actual use case
- We can try with initial size of 60MB and see with real time workload how frequently it get overflow and then we can issue a WARNING
  if it get full so that user can reconfigure different size/ or consider dynamic size hash
- Simplify the query refer CleanQuerytext and generate_normalized_query
  Q: Do we need to copy logic from there or maintain dependency?
